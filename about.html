        <h1>About the GM &AElig;sop for Newbies</h1>
        <p>GM Aesop for Newbies contains the text of selected fables, and will be enjoyed by players of any rank.</p>
        <p>This is a parody site of the <a href="http://www.read.gov/aesop/index.html">Library of Congress's The Aesop for Children</a>, with the original fables slightly modified to be about the game <a href="https://playeternalreturn.com/">Eternal Return</a>.</p>
        <p>Originally started out as a joke when GM Aesop was asked for a fable in the official Discord chat, where he linked <a href="http://www.read.gov/aesop/124.html">Two Travelers & a Bear</a>. Edits were made to the story for humor, and this site serves as a collection for edited fables.</p>
        <p><u>This is NOT an official site of the Library of Congress, nor Nimble Neuron, nor Eternal Return.</u></p>
