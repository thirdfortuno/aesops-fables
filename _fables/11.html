<p>Two Duo Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was the Ancient Tree.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "Maybe come here at night when I spawn!"</p>
