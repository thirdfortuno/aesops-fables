title: The Fox & the Tree of Life
num: 10
---
<p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful Tree of Life hanging from a vine trained along the edge of Hotel. The tree seemed ready to burst with life, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p>
<p>The tree hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to fight for it. The first time he jumped he got chased off by another player. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to be contested by yet another party. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p>
<p>Now he sat down and looked at the tree in disgust.</p>
<p>"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour trees that are not worth gaping for."</p>
<p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>
