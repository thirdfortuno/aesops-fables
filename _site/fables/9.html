        <h1>The Boy & the Materials</h1>

<div> <p>A Boy was given permission to start Factory uncontested. But he needed such a great load of materials that he could not find them all in his loot cluster. There he stood, unwilling to leave the zone until he had checked every box, Day 1 having changed into Night before he finished his boots. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.</p>
<p>"My boy," said his mother, "be satisfied with half the mats you have taken and you will easily sort your build out. Then perhaps you may have some more materials in other zones."</p></div>

<blockquote>Some builds may need too many materials in one area. You may also find needed materials in other areas as well.</blockquote>
