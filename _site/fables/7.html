        <h1>The Travelers & the Sea</h1>

<div> <p>Two Travelers were walking along the Beach. Far out they saw something landing near the waves.</p>
<p>"Look," said one, "a gold airdrop rides in from distant lands, bearing Prominence!"</p>
<p>The object they saw came ever nearer the shore.</p>
<p>"No," said the other, "that is not Prominence!. Those are some Smart Bombs, with that, securing us the final zone!"</p>
<p>Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore.</p>
<p>"It is Boots of Hermes!," they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but EOD Boots.</p></div>
