<p>A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with his work.</p>
<p>"Why are you doing that?" asked the Fox at last with a grin. "There isn't any danger that I can see."</p>
<p>"True enough," replied the Boar, "but when next morning comes there will be newbies trying to kill me to finish their weapon."</p></div>
